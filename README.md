## What is React?
- JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- strictly front-end, runs in the browser
- runs on the client as a SPA (Single Page App)
  - where you have a single html page >> routing is done through React >> compiles to a JS bundle that is lodaded by the browser
- React doesn't have a built-in routing system, unlike [Angular](https://angular.io/), so we have to install an extra package [react router dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

## Why use React?
- Structure the "view" (MVC) layer of your application
- Reusable components (hold their own state, data)
- JSX (Dynamic markup)
- Interactive UIs with virtual DOM (allows you to update parts of the page that need to be updated without reloading the entire page)
- Performance & Testing
- Data management (one-way data binding, all the data in your state is immutable, you can't mutate it directly)
