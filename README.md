## What is React?
- JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- strictly front-end, runs in the browser
- runs on the client as a SPA (Single Page App)
  - where you have a single html page >> routing is done through React >> compiles to a JS bundle that is lodaded by the browser
- React doesn't have a built-in routing system, unlike [Angular](https://angular.io/),
